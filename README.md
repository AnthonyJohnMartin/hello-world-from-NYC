# hello-world-from-NYC
First thing's first... repository project!

Howdy there, this is my first project. 
It was created on May twenty third, two thousand eighteen @ 20:34 in the evening in Manhattan, New York City on my apartment couch.

I currently work in finance at J.P.Morgan. My passions include enjoying music (Jazz and R&B), playing music (Piano), staying active (running long distance races), eating new and exciting foods, and as of now... the intricacies of programming, data science, and software engineering. 

Soon I hope to become a data scientist or a software engineer, making an impactful change to the worlds of sustainable energy or fintech. 

Thanks!
Anthony
